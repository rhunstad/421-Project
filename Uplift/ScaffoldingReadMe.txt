Support for ASP.NET Core Identity was added to your project
- The code for adding Identity to your project was generated under Areas/Identity.

Configuration of the Identity related services can be found in the Areas/Identity/IdentityHostingStartup.cs file.


The generated UI requires support for static files. To add static files to your app:
1. Call app.UseStaticFiles() from your Configure method

To use ASP.NET Core Identity you also need to enable authentication. To authentication to your app:
1. Call app.UseAuthentication() from your Configure method (after static files)

The generated UI requires MVC. To add MVC to your app:
1. Call services.AddMvc() from your ConfigureServices method
2. Call app.UseMvc() from your Configure method (after authentication)

Apps that use ASP.NET Core Identity should also use HTTPS. To enable HTTPS see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848054.



FROM THE OLD PROJECT: 
Scaffolding has generated all the files and added the required dependencies.

However the Application's Startup code may required additional changes for things to work end to end.
Add the following code to the Configure method in your Application's Startup class if not already done:

        app.UseMvc(routes =>
        {
          routes.MapRoute(
            name : "areas",
            template : "{area:exists}/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}"
          );
        });


            DataSource dataSource = DataSource.AzureSql(
                name: "mysqlserver421",
                sqlConnectionString: configuration["AzureSqlConnectionString"],
                tableOrViewName: "Item");
            dataSource.DataChangeDetectionPolicy = new SqlIntegratedChangeTrackingPolicy();

            
            serviceClient.DataSources.CreateOrUpdateAsync(dataSource).Wait();
